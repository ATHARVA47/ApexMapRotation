# ApexMapRotation
This is a python script that fetches the latest public matches map as well as till what time(in IST) in apex legends from www.apexlegendsstatus.com, the benefit of this approach as opposed to going to the website(duh) is that it sends you a windows notification that will persist in your Notifications section, so you can review it again and again.

# Running the script
The python script would require your Windows machine to have the required libraries and python3 installed
For now the paths to the images are of my local device(Ill fix that soon!)
You also require BurntToast for the notifications get it here:
https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast
PowerShell Gallery Install (Requires PowerShell v5)
      Install-Module -Name BurntToast
# The exe
While you should never run an exe off the internet if you want to create your own exe from my python file, so that  it runs without the python installations
